## Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
The TaskController class is designed using the Singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application. This is achieved by overriding the __new__ method to check if an instance already exists and, if not, creating it. The class is responsible for managing tasks, including adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks from the database. It interacts with the Database class and uses methods to handle tasks based on user input, ensuring consistent task management across the application.

**Code Example**:
```python
# class TaskController:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(TaskController, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            cls._instance.db = Database()
        return cls._instance
```
The class is responsible for managing user operations, including registering, logging in, retrieving current user information, and handling user sessions. It interacts with the UserManager class and uses methods to handle user operations based on input, ensuring consistent user management across the application.
```python
# from models.user_manager import UserManager
class UserController:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(UserController, cls).__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)
            cls._instance.user_manager = UserManager()
            cls._instance.current_user = None
        return cls._instance

```
The UserManager class is designed using the Singleton pattern, ensuring that only one instance of this class exists throughout the application. This is achieved by overriding the __new__ method to check if an instance already exists and, if not, creating it. The class is responsible for user management tasks, such as registering and logging in users, and maintaining the current user's state.
```python
class UserManager:
    _instance = None
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_user = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(UserManager, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.current_user = None
            cls._instance.db = Database()
        return cls._instance
```
In Python, cls is a conventionally used parameter name in class methods that refer to the class itself. This is similar to how self refers to the instance of the class in instance methods. Here’s a brief explanation:

### Factory Pattern
It initializes an SQLite database, creates necessary tables for users and tasks, and includes methods for adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks and users. The class ensures security by using PBKDF2HMAC for password hashing and AES for encrypting task descriptions.

**Code Example**:
```python
# class Database:
    def __init__(self, db_name="todo_app.db"):
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
        self.create_tables()
        self.observers = []

    def create_tables(self):
        with self.connection:
```
### Observer Pattern
db.py also implements the observer pattern to notify registered observers of any changes in the database, ensuring consistent task management and real-time updates across the application.

**Code Example**:
```python
 def add_observer(self, observer):
        self.observers.append(observer)

    def remove_observer(self, observer):
        self.observers.remove(observer)

    def notify_observers(self):
        for observer in self.observers:
            observer.update()

``

```python
class Observer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def update(self):
        pass
```
```python
# views/calendar_view.py
self.calendar.bind("<<CalendarSelected>>", self.show_tasks)
```
### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

**Code Example**:
```python
# models/user_manager.py
def register_user(self, username, password):
    if not username or not password:
        return False, "Username and password cannot be empty"
    if self.db.get_user_by_username(username):
        return False, "Username already exists"
    self.db.add_user(username, password)
    return True, "User registered successfully"
```
### Template Method Pattern
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.

**Code Example**:
```python
# db/database.py
def create_tables(self):
    with self.connection:
        self.connection.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                password TEXT NOT NULL
            )
        """)
        self.connection.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                description TEXT NOT NULL,
                timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                start_date DATE,
                end_date DATE,
                repeat TEXT,
                completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL CHECK (completed IN (0, 1)),
                user_id INTEGER,
                FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
            )
        """)
```
### Decorator Pattern
The auth_required decorator is designed to ensure that a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain methods. Here’s how it works:

    Decorator Definition: The auth_required function is defined as a decorator. It takes a function func as an argument.

    Wrapper Function: Inside auth_required, a wrapper function is defined. This wrapper function adds additional behavior before and after the original function func is called.

    Authentication Check:
        The wrapper function retrieves the current user ID by calling self.user_controller.get_current_user_id().
        If no user is logged in (user is None), a warning message is displayed using messagebox.showwarning, informing the user that they must be logged in to perform the action.
        If a user is logged in, the original function func is called with its arguments (*args and **kwargs).

    Using the Decorator: By applying the @auth_required decorator to a method, you ensure that this authentication check is performed every time the method is called.
```python
from functools import wraps
from models.user_manager import UserManager
from tkinter import messagebox


def auth_required(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self,*args, **kwargs):
        user = self.user_controller.get_current_user_id()
        if user is None:
            messagebox.showwarning("Warning", "You must be logged in to perform this action")
            return
        return func(self,*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper
```
### Model-View-Controller Pattern
The Model-View-Controller pattern separates an application into three main parts: Model, View, and Controller.

**Code Example**:
```python
# controllers/task_controller_interface.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TaskControllerInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def add_task(self, description, user_id, start_date=None, end_date=None, repeat=None):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_tasks(self, user_id):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_tasks_by_date(self, user_id, date):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def delete_task(self, task_id):
        pass
```
```python
# controllers/task_controller.py
from models.user_manager import UserManager
from controllers.task_controller_interface import TaskControllerInterface

class TaskController(TaskControllerInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_manager = UserManager()

    def add_task(self, description, user_id, start_date=None, end_date=None, repeat=None):
        if start_date and end_date:
            self.user_manager.db.add_task_with_dates(description, user_id, start_date, end_date, repeat)
        else:
            self.user_manager.db.add_task(description, user_id)

    def get_tasks(self, user_id):
        return self.user_manager.db.get_tasks(user_id)

    def get_tasks_by_date(self, user_id, date):
        return self.user_manager.db.get_tasks_by_date(user_id, date)

    def delete_task(self, task_id):
        self.user_manager.db.delete_task(task_id)
```
